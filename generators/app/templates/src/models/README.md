# Models

This is a directory for you to put model/schema definitions. It assumes the use of `firemodel` in it's example but if you're using a different modelling solution you can put whatever you like here. Having this folder here is an attempt to reinforce some consistency in file structure across projects.

> If this serverless project shares models with a frontend application then you may consider removing the models directory and source all your models for a shared repository who's exclusive function is to define the models. Alternatively you may find that _most_ of the models are defined in the shared repo but that there are some models which are exclusive to this repository. Your call in the end. ;)
