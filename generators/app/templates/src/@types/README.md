# Types

Sometimes it's useful to start by typing your interfaces locally in the handler or elsewhere but eventually you should aim to have all arrive into this directory. 

The `index.ts` is just a "autoindexed" file and should _not_ contain any typing itself so add files into this directory with whatever naming convention makes sense to you and they will automatically be _auto_-indexed into the project.
